# Some Resources for Learning Python

I do not try to make a comprehensive list.
I want to suggest a manageable list of really good resources.

Neither can I be comprehensive. 
This is just what I know are good or look good to me.
And not *all* that I am aware of---this is a selection that I think are good for **learners**.


## Prerequisites

If you do not already know this---*please*, **please** decompose, decompose, and then decompose.
A couple short reads to reinforce this basic idea to you:

- [Decomposition & Style](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/compdocs/Decomposition_and_Style.pdf) (pdf)
  by Nick Parlante.

- [Improve your code with atomic functions](https://www.codementor.io/seantullis/improve-your-code-with-atomic-functions-r6dt43fy7)

- [Google style Python docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
  This is the style I have adopted loosely.
  But, it is *by far* more important to have useful *doc*,
  regardless of the format.
